The hybrid model combining XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression leverages the strengths of different algorithms to improve prediction accuracy. XGBoost and Random Forest are powerful tree-based models, capable of handling non-linear relationships and complex patterns, while Linear Regression serves as a meta-model to combine their outputs. The stacking method helps reduce model bias and variance, enhancing the generalization ability of the model. This approach improves performance on both regression and classification tasks, particularly in scenarios with diverse and intricate feature interactions.

Key Points on Working:
- Base Models*: XGBoost, Random Forest
- Meta-Model*: Linear Regression
- Stacking*: Combines base models' predictions
- Improves Accuracy*: By leveraging multiple models' strengths
